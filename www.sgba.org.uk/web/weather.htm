<h1>Tides&nbsp;
</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1em;" ;=""> The 2019 tide tables are here.</p>
<p>Since October 2010, Stoke Gabriel (Duncannon) has had its own
official tidal predictions and these have been published on an annual
basis by the SGBA in booklet form. 
</p>
<p>Stoke Gabriel Tides 2019 is now available from the Village Stores (Roz's) and the River Dart Gallery as well as at SGBA events.</p>
<p> 
<img style="width: 400px; height: 562px;" alt="2019 tides" src="images/2019_tides.jpg"></p>
<p>As in the previous seven years, the tide tables consist of the
official UK Hydrographic Office predictions of the times and heights of
high water and low water for Stoke Gabriel (Duncannon). They are
adjusted for British Summer Time and presented in a reader-friendly
format.</p>
<p>The 2019 booklet includes <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NEW pilotage instructions for entering the Creek</span> which can also be dowloaded from <a href="Entering%20the%20Creek/Entering%20the%20creek.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p> The booklet also includes online addresses of websites that
give the actual and predicted tidal curves for Stoke Gabriel and
a Flood Alert page, listing the dates of all High Waters that reach
4.8m or more.</p>
<p>The tide tables booklet sells for a modest &pound;2 per copy. It is
produced by the SGBA and, thanks to our advertisers (who cover the
printing costs), all proceeds go towards the SGBA, helping to maintain
its splendid new clubhouse at Mill Point and its fleet of 50 boats. </p>
<p style="font-size: 1em;" ;="">Buy your copy today  &ndash;  or maybe several!</p>
<h1>Weather</h1>
<p>Wind, weather and tides are crucial to any boating trip,
especially in
Stoke Gabriel where the creek dries at low water on spring tides.
Before planning any trip check the tides and weather.
</p>
<p>Everyone has their favourite online weather forecaster. The
SGBA
does not endorse any website in particular, but you might want to try
