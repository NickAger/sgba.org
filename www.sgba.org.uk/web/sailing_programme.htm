<h1>Sunday Sailing and Boating</h1>


<p>Throughout the spring, summer and early autumn we have a
programme
of Sunday sailing. Members can just come along to Mill Point, rig up
and take out an SGBA sailing dinghy, rowing boat or canoe, or join us
in their own boat. Sunday sailings are co-ordinated by the Officer of
the Day (OOD), who is responsible for ensuring the safety boat is on
the water and keeping track of who is out in which dinghy. Having
satisfied the OOD that you are competent on the water, you will be free
to take out any of the club dinghies. Although there is always a safety
boat on duty, members remain responsible for their own safety at all
time and children must not be left unattended during Sunday sailings.
Everyone sailing as part of the event must wear a bouyancy aid at all
times. Please note that there is an annual fee for use of club boats
payable to the Membership Secretary.</p>


<h1>Junior Sailing</h1>


<p>The SGBA Junior Sailing Courses are an opportunity for your child to
learn to sail whilst having a huge amount of fun on the river. Children
will develop water confidence and river safety, and may also get a
sailing qualification.</p>


<h1>Dinghy Course - Adult Beginner &amp; Improver</h1>


<p>We will continue to run these in 2019.</p>


<p>Details on the <a href="http://www.sgba.org.uk/training.htm">Training Page.</a></p>


<h1>Social Sailing and Boating</h1>


<p>
There is a group of keen dinghy
sailors who meet during the summer months, mostly on alternate Thursday
evenings, but sometimes on another day due to tides. If you are
interested in joining
the group, contact the Sailing Secretary or just come and see what's
happening.
Please follow the link to the Sailing &amp; Events site for dates
and some
important conditions - these evenings are not club events.</p>


<h1>Racing </h1>


<p>
During Sunday Sailings, if enough experienced
sailors are on the water, the Officer of the Day may set up a dinghy
race. Also,
summer evening sailing is often in the form of an informal race.</p>


<h1>Regatta</h1>


<p>
Towards the middle of September every year, the
SGBA holds its annual regatta. A day of dinghy and rowing racing, the
regatta
is the culmination of the year's Sunday sailings. The main event is a
race up
and down the river off Mill Point for the dinghies and keel boats.
Everyone can
enter in their own boat or a club dinghy (although it is often wise to
reserve
the dinghy you want to race).</p>


<h1>Other Water-based activities</h1>


<p>Members often ask about different things they&rsquo;d like to see happen: more formal racing, canoeing, rowing, etc.</p>


<p>Is there something you&rsquo;d like the club to organise? Do you want to organise it or be part of the organising team?</p>


<p>This is not about activities arranged between friends, but properly organised club events.</p>


<p>If you have any ideas you&rsquo;d like to discuss, let Roger Astley
know - it would be good to have some more events and more members
involved.</p>


</div>


<div class="rcol" style="width: 320px;">
<h1>Sunday Sailing 2019</h1>


<p>Sunday Sailing will take place on the dates shown below but only
with the necessary people to run them i.e. OOD and safety boat helm
&amp; crew. </p>


<p>We need to find three names for each event before it can go
ahead.
So before turning up for a Sailing and Boating Event 
check that the necessary officials are in place and the time hasn't changed by visiting the</p>
