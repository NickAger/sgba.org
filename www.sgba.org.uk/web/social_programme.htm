<h1>Social Activities</h1>






<p>The SGBA is as much a social club for members as a serious
boating
association. Our members enjoy meeting for sailing events in the summer
and shore based activities in the winter months.
</p>






<p>The social programme is co-ordinated by the Social Secretary.
If you
have any suggestions for future events; if you are able to help
organise events or if you simply want more information about a
forthcoming event, please contact The Social Secretary.
</p>






<h1>Social sailing
</h1>






<p>Throughout the summer a programme of waterside events keeps
sailors
and non-sailors busy. Sunday sailings are primarily about sailing but
many members simply come down to enjoy watching the river busy with
people enjoying the water and to catch up with friends.
</p>






<h1>Volunteer days
</h1>






<p>A couple of times a year the SGBA organises volunteer days
when
members and their families join us to clear up the foreshore, help
improve the clubs facilities or provide labour on a building job.
Volunteers are always rewarded with lunch or afternoon tea.
</p>






<h1>Village events
</h1>






<p>Stoke Gabriel is a thriving village with a busy and active
social
calendar and the SGBA contributes to this. In recent years we have
organised Waterborne Treasure Hunts, the Middle Back Bash and a Low
Tide Cricket match against Dittisham Sailing Club on Middle Back. During
Carnival Week, towards the end of July, we organise an SGBA carnival float. </p>














<p>If you have any ideas or
requests for other types of social events, do contact the social secretary. We&rsquo;re keen that there
is something for everyone and for all ages, so if you think you are
missing out just let us know.</p>
