        <h1>Social Activities</h1>






        <p>The SGBA is as much a social club for members as a serious
          boating
          association. Our members enjoy meeting for sailing events in the summer
          and shore based activities in the winter months.
        </p>






        <p>The social programme is co-ordinated by the Social Secretary.
          If you
          have any suggestions for future events; if you are able to help
          organise events or if you simply want more information about a
          forthcoming event, please contact The Social Secretary.
        </p>






        <h1>Social sailing
        </h1>






        <p>Throughout the summer a programme of waterside events keeps
          sailors
          and non-sailors busy. Sunday sailings are primarily about sailing but
          many members simply come down to enjoy watching the river busy with
          people enjoying the water and to catch up with friends.
        </p>






        <h1>Volunteer days
        </h1>






        <p>A couple of times a year the SGBA organises volunteer days
          when
          members and their families join us to clear up the foreshore, help
          improve the clubs facilities or provide labour on a building job.
          Volunteers are always rewarded with lunch or afternoon tea.
        </p>






        <h1>Village events
        </h1>






        <p>Stoke Gabriel is a thriving village with a busy and active
          social
          calendar and the SGBA contributes to this. In recent years we have
          organised Waterborne Treasure Hunts, the Middle Back Bash and a Low
          Tide Cricket match against Dittisham Sailing Club on Middle Back. During
          Carnival Week, towards the end of July, we organise an SGBA carnival float. </p>














        <p>If you have any ideas or
          requests for other types of social events, do contact the social secretary. We&rsquo;re keen that there
          is something for everyone and for all ages, so if you think you are
          missing out just let us know.</p>
