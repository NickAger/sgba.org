<h1>SGBA induction programme for the new boats</h1>

<p>

The induction program provides members with the opportunity to learn
how to access, care for and get the best out of the new boats. Most of
the time will be on the water with an expert helm supporting as you put
the boat through the manoeuvres required of RYA PB1 (and 2 if you want
to).&nbsp; See summary of standard below.</p>

<p>

A fee of &pound;10 is payable at booking. (Make cheques for payment
to SGBA) which will be refunded on supply of a copy your RYA PB1 or PB2
certificate valid at the time of the induction. </p>

<p>

Book an induction course via the Bosun or Quartermaster. </p>
