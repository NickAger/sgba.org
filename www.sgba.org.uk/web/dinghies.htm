        <h1>The SGBA dinghies</h1>
        <p>The SGBA owns a fleet of sailing dinghies, 7 Toppers, 6 Laser Bugs,
          6 Laser Picos, 2 lasers and a Wanderer. They are clearly
          marked with a sticker saying "Owned by the SGBA", all are stored in the
          quarry near the Boat House at Mill Point. They are available for use by
          members and their accompanied children.</p>
        <p>If you have have paid the &pound;40 annual
          boat user charge you may use the club
          dinghies for free whenever you
          want. Remember you must always wear a bouyancy aid, you are responsible
          for anyone in the dinghy and you must report any damage or missing
          equipment to the Quartermaster (Sail). Please read the guidelines on using the club
          boats before using any club boat.</p>
        <h1>Association Sailing</h1>
        <p>Throughout the spring, summer and early autumn we have an extensive sailing programme
          - follow the link to the Summer Programme for details.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h1>Sailing your own boat</h1>
        <p>Many SGBA members have their own boats and the SGBA has facilities to support members using their own boats,
          and
          events to bring members together on the water.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><img style="width: 448px; height: 336px;" alt="Junior Sailing Week 2013" src="images/4.jpg"></p>
        <h1>Scillabub</h1>
        <p>The club was very generously donated a Drascombe Lugger called Scillabub. Various members including Steve
          Goodchild, Stanley Brown and Roger Stobbart have worked very hard restoring her to make her ready for use by
          club members!</a>.</p>
        <p><img style="width: 400px; height: 301px;" alt="Cygnet" title="Cygnet" src="images/scillabub.jpg"></p>
        <p>Scillabub can be booked using the form below:</p>

          <p class="white">Conditions for using dinghies</p>
        </div>
        <p>All members who have paid the &pound;40 annual
          boat user charge may use the club
          dinghies for free subject to the following conditions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Buoyancy aids must
            be worn at all times whilst using SGBA craft.</li>
          <li>Adult members of the club (those over 16 years) may use the sailing
            dinghies without being accompanied by a safety boat.</li>
          <li>Members under 16 may use club dinghies outside of
            club events provided that parents or guardians (two adults) are in
            attendance in an SGBA safety boat or one with similar performance and
            equipment. The club cannot advise for all conditions, so members
            supervising juniors are expected to follow the advice of a qualified
            instructor and RYA guidelines. Note that the minimum qualification for
            a safety helm at an SGBA club event is Powerboat Level 2. If a
            parent/guardian considers the junior to be sufficiently experienced and
            conditions permit safe sailing, he/she may supervise the child from
            another dinghy.</li>
          <li>The sailing area for the
            dinghies is from Duncannon and/or Tuckenhay to the Anchor Stone.
          </li>
          <li>Any breakages or missing or defective gear on the sailing dinghies
            or canoes should be reported to the Bosun.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>If you use a club dinghy please ensure that when you return it you
            securely attach to either the standing chain or the rail (Pico&rsquo;s)
            using either the supplied lock or the boat's painter. This will ensure
            that the boats will not be damaged or lost during high spring tides.
            Thank you.
