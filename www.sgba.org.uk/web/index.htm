        <p style="font-size:25px">Welcome to the Stoke Gabriel Boating Association</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px">...because we are more than just a Sailing Club</p>

      </div>

      <div class="lcol" style="width: 550px;">





        <p style="font-size:15px">The name of the Club is deliberately formed as the &ldquo;Boating
          Association&rdquo; and not a &ldquo;Yacht Club&rdquo;.&nbsp;The reason
          for this is that we offer a welcome to all people who wish to enjoy the various means of having fun on the
          water. Here are a few key
          points for visitors to the web site and hopefully to the club.</p>

        <p><a href="dinghies.htm">
            <font size="5px">More
              than 50 club-owned boats
          </a></font>await members subscribing to boat use and can
          be used at club events or at any daylight time.&nbsp;Over 50 ways to
          enjoy the lovely River Dart. Paddle boards, kayaks, Canadian canoes,
          rowing boats and a range of sailing dinghies for solo sails and family
          cruises. When not &ldquo;on duty&rdquo; our safety boats are also
          available for suitably qualified members to hire at a modest cost
          charged merely to cover fuel.</p>

        <p>
          <font size="5px">No storage or maintenance</font> to worry about although all work is
          undertaken by enthusiastic members. We hope all members will contribute
          some time to join work parties or take on solo projects to keep our
          great fleet and bright modern facilities looking good and working well.
          We adopt the &ldquo;many hands make light work&rdquo; principle and
          enjoy a lot of fun getting jobs done. Also, a haven for some members
          who like to retreat quietly to exercise their practical skills or do
          some quiet work.
        </p>



        <p><a href="training.htm">
            <font size="5px">RYA Training Centre</font>
          </a> dedicated to introducing young and less young
          people to the joys of boating, providing routes to training and
          development of skills and knowledge for all. At whatever age, lives can
          be busy and pressured so learning skills, formally or informally, that
          equip us to escape a little, absorbed by healthy activity in beautiful
          natural surroundings shared with the birds, fish and seals is a great
          antidote to the hurly burly.</p>






        <p>
          <font size="5px">Modern club building</font>, workshop and boat store make it easy and
          comfortable to get on and off the water. We have spacious changing
          rooms and showers, a kitchenette for members and a bright room with a
          stunning view of the river for training, social gatherings, meetings or
          just sitting. All these facilities plus barbecue equipment and outdoor
          seating are open to members to use in all daylight hours.
        </p>



        <p><a href="membership.htm">
            <font size="5px">Open, inclusive and friendly membership</font>
          </a> is the magic ingredient of
          this great club. With members, very young to quite senior, drawn from
          Stoke Gabriel and much further afield there is an overriding spirit and
          enthusiasm to welcome new members and encourage everyone on to the
          water as much as possible to enjoy the river. Membership runs from
          March to February but is open throughout the year with no prerequisites
          to join.</p>



        <p>
          <font size="5px">Non Members</font> are welcome when signed in and accompanied by a member,
          up to three occasions in a season.&nbsp; Our club room is also
          available to hire for meetings and events by members and non members.
        </p>


        <p>
          <font size="5px">Visit and see for yourself</font> and a committee member will show you

        <div class="bluebar">
          <p class="white">Parking at the Quay Car Park</p>



        </div>



        <p>The parking area of the quay and lawns around the Mill Pond are
          privately owned and operated as a business. Managing the lawns, the
          quay side parking area, fencing, staffing and paying for insurance etc
          are just some of the expenses incurred in maintaining the parking
          facility throughout the year. </p>



        <p>Fees are charged in the summer season, starting on Good Friday, but
          the owners kindly allow local residents to park for limited periods on
          the quay side free of charge during the normal working days of Monday
          to Friday. On high season weekends and Bank Holidays, though, they need
          to charge for every space in order to generate sufficient income. SGBA
          members are reminded that on such days everyone, local and visitor,
          will be charged the standard rate for parking. </p>



        <p>Should members need regular parking on the quay the most cost
          effective option is to purchase a season ticket, allowing unlimited
          parking on any day of the year.
        </p>

        <p>The annual booklet of Stoke Gabriel tide tables is now available
          from Stoke Gabriel Stores (Roz&rsquo;s) and the River Shack, as well as
          at SGBA events.</p>

        <div class="bluebar">
          <p class="white">We are on Whats App</p>



        </div>



        <p>We learned from the Survey in 2017 that many members
          prefer to sail or paddle when others will be on the river, rather than
          on their own. So we have set up a What&rsquo;s App group through which
          members will get alerts when others are going afloat and through which
          those in the group can make arrangements with each other. </p>



        <p>To join the group, text your name and mobile number to:
          River Lovejoy on 07523 544986.</p>
