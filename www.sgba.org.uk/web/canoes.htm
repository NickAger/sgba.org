<h1>Canoes and Kayaks&nbsp;</h1>

<p>The
SGBA has two "Kiwi 3" two-person kayaks, one two person "Tarpon 130T"
sit on top and three Canadian canoes that can be used by club
members who have paid the &pound;40 annual fee for the use of
club-owned boats.</p>

<p>The canoes and kayaks are stored behind the boat house at the
Quarry at Mill Point. They are clearly marked with the "Owned by the
SGBA" sticker. You will need to know the SGBA combination lock code to
access them and the boat house itself, where the paddles are stored. An
additional child's seat for the kayaks is also stored in the boat house.</p>

<p>Members are responsible for providing and wearing their own
Lifejackets and buoyancy aids.</p>

<p>Children can use the kayaks provided they are accompanied by
an adult (in either a kayak, SGBA motorboat or another suitable craft).</p>

<p>The canoes and kayaks must not be dragged along the foreshore
and care should be taken when grounding and launching not to damage the
hulls. Any damage or loss to the boats needs to be reported to the
Bosun or Quartermaster.</p>

<p>If you have your own canoe or kayak, you can apply for
foreshore
storage on the SGBA canoe racks. Please contact the Dinghy Park Officer
for more information.</p>
